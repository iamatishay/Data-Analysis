üìû G.A.R.V.I.S - Geospatial Analysis and Reporting for Visualizing Inefficiencies in Signal
G.A.R.V.I.S is a powerful web application built with Streamlit that enables telecom analysts to visually analyze and report inefficiencies in signal strength across various regions. This tool is particularly useful for mapping drop call rates and understanding their distribution across different technologies like 2G, 3G, and 4G.

üåü Key Features:
Interactive Map Visualization: Visualize drop call rates with heatmaps and clustered markers, categorized by technology.
Customizable Filters: Filter data by quarter, telecom service provider (TSP), LSA code, and technology.
Dynamic Data Representation: Analyze and display distribution charts for Cell Q(90) values and technology usage.
Downloadable Map: Save and download the interactive map for offline viewing.
User Authentication: Secure login system for authorized access.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
Streamlit: For the interactive web interface.
Folium: For rendering maps with customized markers and heatmaps.
Plotly: For generating dynamic bar and pie charts.
Pandas: For data manipulation and filtering.
PostgreSQL: As the backend database to store and query telecom data.
This project is designed to help telecom regulators and analysts in assessing and improving the quality of service provided by telecom operators. Explore the data visually and make data-driven decisions with ease!
