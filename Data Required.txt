To run the G.A.R.V.I.S program, the table map_app in your PostgreSQL database needs to contain the following columns:

--CGI (Cell Global Identity): A unique identifier for the cell site, which is used to differentiate between different cells in the network.

--Latitude: The geographic latitude coordinate of the cell site, used for mapping the cell's location.

--Longitude: The geographic longitude coordinate of the cell site, used for mapping the cell's location.

--Cell_Q_90: The 90th percentile of call quality metrics (e.g., drop call rate) for the cell. This is used to categorize the signal quality into different ranges.

--LSA Code (License Service Area Code): The code representing the geographic area (state or region) where the cell is located. This is used for filtering and regional analysis.

--State/ UT: The name of the state or union territory where the cell is located. This is used for display purposes in tooltips and further filtering.

--Quarter: The quarter (e.g., Q1 2024) when the data was recorded. This allows for temporal filtering and analysis.

--Technology: The technology used by the cell site (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G). This is used for filtering and visual differentiation on the map.

--TSP (Telecom Service Provider): The name of the telecom service provider operating the cell site. This allows for filtering by different providers.

--Days: The number of days within the selected period where the drop call rate (DCR) exceeded 2%. This is used for filtering the severity of signal issues.

Summary of Required Columns:
1.CGI
2.Latitude
3.Longitude
4.Cell_Q_90
5.LSA Code
6.State/ UT
7.Quarter
8.Technology
9.TSP
10.Days
These columns are essential for the functioning of the application, as they provide the necessary data for geospatial visualization, filtering, and analysis of telecom signal quality.
